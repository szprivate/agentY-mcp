# Storyboard Breakdown

Turn an entire storyline into the textual blueprint for a short film. You then
render the blueprint by generating a character sheet, a start-frame image per
sequence, and a Kling multi-shot video per sequence (via the `comfyui-generate`
and `kling-multishot` skills).

First write **text only** — produce two things:
1. A readable **story bible + prose breakdown**, then
2. A **single trailing JSON block** (the machine-readable contract you act on when
   rendering each sequence).

This mode extends Mode B (`story-scene`): same consistency discipline, but the
shots are additionally **grouped into Kling sequences** and emitted as JSON.

---

## 1. Story bible (consistency anchors)
Define these **once**, before the sequences, and reuse them **verbatim** wherever
the element reappears (paraphrasing breaks visual consistency downstream):

- **Characters** — list **EVERY acting person / character** in the script (lead,
  supporting, and minor — anyone who appears on screen), not just the lead. For
  each: a stable **tag** (e.g. `MARA`) followed by a fixed visual description
  (approximate age, build, hair, skin, wardrobe, 1–2 distinguishing features).
  This exact string is the **character lock** — copy it, never reword it. Track
  how many **shots** each character appears in across the whole script (this
  drives whether you make a multi-angle chart for them).
- **Locations / props** — fixed descriptions of recurring places and key objects
  (materials, colour, condition).

## 2. Split the WHOLE story into sequences
- Break the entire storyline into ordered **shots**, then group the shots into
  **sequences**. A sequence is one Kling multi-shot clip.
- **Hard per-sequence limits (never exceed):** at most **6 shots**, and the sum
  of a sequence's shot durations must be **≤ 10 seconds**.

### Length & shot budget — honour what the user asked for
Before defaulting anything, read the brief for an explicit **total video length**
and/or **total shot count** and treat them as hard targets, in this order:

1. **Both total length and shot count given** (e.g. "10 seconds, 5 shots"):
   per-shot duration = round(total_length ÷ shot_count), minimum 1s. Produce
   *exactly* that many shots. Example: 10s ÷ 5 shots → five 2-second shots.
2. **Only total length given** (e.g. "a 10-second clip"): keep the sum of all
   shot durations across the whole film equal to that length. Pick a shot count
   that fits — "fast-paced" / "snappy" → more, shorter shots (2–3s);
   "slow" / "lingering" → fewer, longer shots.
3. **Only shot count given:** use exactly that many shots; default each to 5s
   unless pacing words say otherwise.
4. **Neither given (open-ended story):** default each shot to **5 seconds**
   (≈2 shots per 10s sequence) and use **as many sequences as needed** to cover
   the story start to finish — do not stop early.

After deciding the shots and their durations, **pack them into the FEWEST
sequences** that still satisfy the per-sequence limits above (≤6 shots AND ≤10s
each). Five 2-second shots = 10s total = **one** sequence, not three. Only open a
new sequence when the next shot would breach the 6-shot or 10-second limit.

Pacing words ("fast-paced", "rapid cuts", "quick", "snappy") mean **shorter shots
and more cuts** — never inflate the total length or add sequences to fit a
default 5s/shot.

## 3. Per sequence
- **Start frame** — a vivid single-still description that opens the sequence,
  including the **character lock verbatim**. This becomes the video's first frame.
- **Shots** — for each shot, a Kling-style prompt following the formula:
  `[character lock] + [transition cue] + [subject motion] + [camera move] + [end state] + [style]`.
  Keep each shot prompt **≤ 480 characters**. Open shots after the first with a
  transition cue (`Continuous from previous shot:`, `Moments later:`, etc.) and
  end each shot by describing the subject's final position for clean hand-off.

## Consistency rules (critical)
- Recurring characters, locations and props must be described with the **same
  wording every time**. Copy the bible; never paraphrase.
- Keep each character's **tag** identical across all sequences.
- Prefer concrete, camera-visible detail over interior states.

## Style
- Present tense, concrete, visual — prioritise what a camera would see.

## Required JSON contract (emit LAST, nothing after it)
After the prose breakdown, output **exactly one** fenced ```json block matching
this schema. It must reflect the prose above. Durations are integers (seconds);
each sequence's durations must sum to ≤ 10.

```json
{
  "characters": [
    {"tag": "NAME", "description": "<verbatim character lock string>", "shot_count": 3}
  ],
  "guidelines": "<short echo of the FOOTAGE visual style (grade/film-look/quality) — this applies to the start frames and videos, NOT to the character sheets, which are always clean reference assets>",
  "sequences": [
    {
      "index": 1,
      "summary": "<one line>",
      "character_tags": ["NAME"],
      "start_frame_prompt": "<vivid single still that opens the sequence, includes the character lock(s) verbatim>",
      "shots": [
        {"prompt": "<character lock + transition + subject motion + camera move + end state + style, <=480 chars>", "duration": 5}
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

- `characters` must list **every acting person/character** in the script, each with
  its `tag`, verbatim `description`, and `shot_count` (total shots it appears in
  across all sequences).
- Each sequence's `character_tags` lists the tags of the characters present in
  that sequence (use the exact tags from `characters`); use `[]` for a sequence
  with no character on screen.
- If the story has **no characters at all**, set `characters` to `[]`.
- Do not add any commentary, notes, or text **after** the JSON block.

## Scope
Stay textual. Do not call image/video tools and do not claim to render media —
your output is the blueprint that hands off to the generation agents.
