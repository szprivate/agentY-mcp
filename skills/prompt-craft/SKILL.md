## CLIP Basics
- 77-token limit per chunk; words = 1–3 tokens each. Tokens past the limit are **silently dropped**.
- Use `BREAK` to force a new 77-token chunk for long prompts.

## Weight Syntax
| Syntax | Weight |
|--------|--------|
| `(word:N)` | Explicit (0.0–2.0; >1.5 causes artifacts) |
| `(word)` / `((word))` / `(((word)))` | 1.1 / 1.21 / 1.331 |
| `[word]` / `[[word]]` | 0.909 / 0.826 |

Phrases work: `(red sports car:1.3)`. Nesting is multiplicative.

## Embeddings
Syntax: `embedding:name` (file must exist in `models/embeddings/`).  
Use in **negatives** for SD 1.5 / SDXL: `embedding:easynegative`, `embedding:badhandv4`, `embedding:negativeXL_D`.

## Model Quick-Reference

### SD 1.5
- **Negative: critical.** Use quality tags + embeddings.
- Positive: `(masterpiece:1.2), (best quality:1.2), subject, details, style`
- Negative: `worst quality, low quality, blurry, bad anatomy, bad hands, extra fingers, watermark, embedding:easynegative`
- Tag-based (danbooru style) works well. Keep under 77 tokens or use `BREAK`.

### SDXL
- **Negative: moderate importance.**
- Natural language preferred over tags. Dual CLIP supports ~154 tokens natively — no `BREAK` needed unless prompt exceeds ~154 tokens.
- Use `CLIPTextEncodeSDXL` for separate `text_g` (global concept) / `text_l` (local detail) control.
- Turbo/Lightning variants: use minimal or empty negative.

### Flux
- **No negative prompt** — omit the negative entirely.
- T5-XXL encoder: write natural descriptive sentences, not tag lists.
- Long prompts (200+ tokens) work fine.
- **Don't use** quality tags (`masterpiece`, `best quality`) — describe quality in prose.

### SD3 / SD3.5
- Triple CLIP (CLIP-L + CLIP-G + T5-XXL). Long natural language prompts.
- Minimal negatives (`low quality, blurry` is enough).

## Prompt Order (SD 1.5 / SDXL)
1. Quality modifiers → 2. Subject → 3. Subject details → 4. Action/pose → 5. Environment → 6. Composition → 7. Lighting → 8. Style → 9. Technical quality

## LoRA Trigger Words
Place the LoRA's exact trigger word(s) naturally in the prompt. Check the model page for triggers. Multiple LoRAs: one trigger each; keep node strength at default unless tuning.

## BREAK Example
```
masterpiece, detailed Japanese garden, cherry blossoms, koi pond, morning mist
BREAK
8k uhd, photorealistic, volumetric lighting, depth of field, golden hour
```

## Video & API Model Guides

### WAN 2.1 / 2.2 (T2V and I2V)
**Prompt formula:** `Subject (desc) + Scene (desc) + Motion (desc) + Camera language + Atmosphere + Styling`  
**Target length:** 80–120 words. Under-specify → model fills in random defaults; over-specify → details ignored.

**T2V:** Write full natural language. Describe who/what, setting, action, camera, and lighting explicitly.  
**I2V:** The image defines *what*. Focus the prompt entirely on *how things move* — camera behavior, subject motion, environmental effects, speed. Do **not** redescribe the image content.

**Camera verbs that work reliably (2.2 > 2.1):** dolly-in, dolly-out, pull back, pan left/right, tilt up/down, tracking shot, orbital shot, bird's-eye, low-angle. Use **one** camera move per generation. Whip pan is unreliable on both versions.

**Negative prompt (supported):** `worst quality, low quality, blurry, static, morphing, warping, flickering, deformed face, extra fingers, watermark, subtitle`

**WAN 2.2 vs 2.1:** Prompt approach is identical for both versions. Camera direction is more reliable in 2.2.

### Kling (2.x / 3.0)
**Prompt formula:** `Subject (specific details) + Action (precise movement) + Context (3–5 elements) + Style (camera, lighting, mood)`  
Write like a film director giving scene instructions, not like an image prompt.

**Hard limits (API-enforced):** positive prompt ≤ 2500 characters · negative prompt ≤ 2500 characters. Prompts exceeding these are rejected — not silently truncated.

**Key principles:**
- Always specify camera behavior explicitly — without it, the model guesses and output looks static or random.
- Anchor hands/limbs to objects to prevent floating (`"fingers grip the edge of the cup"` not `"she moves her hands"`).
- For I2V: describe motion only; never redescribe the image.
- Use motion endpoints to prevent hangs: `"spins, then settles back into place"`.
- Negative prompts are recommended: `smiling, cartoonish, smooth plastic skin, floating limbs, sliding feet, text morphing`

**Kling 3.0 additions:** Multi-shot up to 6 shots in one prompt — label each explicitly (`Shot 1: …, Shot 2: …`). Native audio/dialogue: name speakers explicitly. Reference images addressable as `@image1`, `@image2`.

**Physics tip (walking):** Describe weight transfer explicitly — `"each step lands heel-first, rolls forward with visible weight transfer"` — to prevent the AI moonwalk.

### Kling 3.0 — Multishot
**Prompt formula per shot:** `[CHARACTER LOCK] + [ENVIRONMENT] + [TRANSITION CUE] + [SUBJECT MOTION] + [CAMERA MOVE] + [END STATE] + [STYLE]`  
Label shots explicitly: `Shot 1: … Shot 2: …` up to 6 shots per generation.

**Hard limits (API-enforced):** entire multi-shot prompt ≤ 2500 characters total · negative prompt ≤ 2500 characters. With 6 shots this leaves ~400 characters per shot — keep each shot description tight.

**Character lock:** Paste the **exact same** character description at the start of every shot. Never paraphrase — Kling anchors identity to this string.

**Transition cues (shot 2+):** Open each shot with one of: `Continuous from previous shot:` / `Immediately following:` / `Moments later:` / `Reverse angle:`

**Motion rules:**
- Write subject motion and camera motion as separate sentences.
- Be specific: `"she slowly raises her right hand"` not `"she moves"`.
- One gesture OR one camera move per 5s shot — not both.

**Camera vocabulary:** `slow push-in` · `pull-back reveal` · `static locked` · `orbit/arc shot` · `crane up` · `handheld drift` · `rack focus`

**End-frame handoff:** Describe the subject's final position at the end of each shot. Open the next shot referencing that state — this is what creates continuity across separate generations.

**Negative prompt (apply to all shots):** `blurry, deformed hands, morphing face, identity change, flickering, jerky motion, warped background, two people`

**Failure modes:**

| Problem | Fix |
|---|---|
| Face changes between shots | Verbatim character lock + use last-frame input image |
| Camera drifts on locked shot | Add `"camera does not move under any circumstances"` |
| Lighting inconsistency | Copy-paste lighting string — don't paraphrase it |
| Motion doesn't complete | One action per shot; extend to 8–10s if needed |
| Shots feel disconnected | Missing end-frame handoff |
| Accessories disappear | Name them in the character lock phrase every shot |

### Qwen Image Edit (2511 / fp8)
This model takes an **instruction** rather than a descriptive prompt. It uses dual encoding (Qwen2.5-VL semantic + VAE appearance), so it understands both high-level meaning and low-level pixel appearance.

**Instruction patterns that work:**
- `"Keep [X], change [Y] to [Z]"`
- `"Replace the [material/object] with [reference], preserve [geometry/lighting]"`
- `"Enhance [attribute], leave [other elements] unchanged"`
- Multi-image: `"Apply the leather texture from Figure 2 to the chair in Figure 1, keep the frame unchanged, match lighting."`

**Do:**
- Be explicit and short. One clear edit goal per instruction.
- Specify what must stay unchanged — the model uses this to preserve identity and geometry.

**Don't:**
- Stack multiple conflicting edits in one pass.
- Use tag-soup or quality keywords — this is an instruction model, not CLIP.
- Use `photorealistic`, `3D render` etc. — say `photograph` for realism.
- Pack the negative prompt with keywords; use natural language describing what you don't want.

### Nano Banana 2 / Nano Banana Pro (Gemini Image)
**Nano Banana 2** — best for editing, style transfer, iteration. **Nano Banana Pro** — best for complex layouts, infographics, text rendering, brand consistency. Both support up to 14 reference images (10 objects + 4 characters).

**Both models:** Natural language only — no tag soups, no quality keywords like `masterpiece`. They reason through prompts before generating.

**Prompt formula:** `Subject + Action + Location/Context + Composition + Lighting/Atmosphere + Style + [optional: text/constraint]`  
Example: `"A stoic robot barista with glowing blue optics preparing espresso in a rain-soaked Tokyo alley at night. Low-angle tracking shot. Neon reflections on wet pavement. Cinematic, desaturated teal-orange grade."`

**Text rendering (Pro especially):** Enclose desired text in quotes in the prompt. Specify font style: `"bold white sans-serif"` or `"Century Gothic"`. For complex text-heavy images, first describe the text concepts conversationally, then request the image.

**Editing (conversational):** If an output is 80% right, don't regenerate — issue a follow-up instruction: `"Keep everything, change the lighting to golden hour and make the jacket leather."` The model does semantic masking automatically.

**Character consistency:** Upload reference images and assign names in the prompt. Supports up to 14 references.

**Don't:** Use `4k, trending on artstation, masterpiece` spam. Don't re-describe a reference image; just name it and specify the change.

## Common Mistakes
1. Negative prompt or CFG > 1 with Flux → artifacts
2. Tag-style prompts for Flux / SD3 → use sentences
3. Missing `BREAK` on 60+ word prompts → silent truncation
4. Weight > 1.5 → artifacts / color bleed
5. Conflicting weighted terms → confuses model
6. Wrong LoRA trigger word → concept doesn't activate
7. Quality tags (`masterpiece`) in Flux prompts → ignored
