description: Auto-populated learnings from past high-iteration problem-solving sessions. Activate this skill when you notice you are making repeated tool calls to solve the same sub-problem, or when the same error keeps appearing. The entries below document past problems and proven solutions — consult them before retrying a failing pattern.

## When to activate this skill

Activate and consult this skill when you observe any of the following:
- You have already made **3 or more tool calls** attempting to fix the same issue.
- A tool call fails and you are about to retry with the same approach.
- You are uncertain how to proceed and the task feels repetitive.

Scan the learnings log below for entries that match your current situation.
If a matching entry exists, **apply the documented solution directly** instead of re-discovering it.

## Learnings Log

<!-- The learnings agent automatically appends new entries below this line. -->
<!-- Format: date | problem summary | solution (1–2 sentences) -->
2026-05-12 | CLIPLoader validation fails with incorrect clip_name or missing type | Use get_node_schema to identify the exact clip_name string and the required type value.

2026-05-12 | CLIPLoader validation fails when clip_name lacks subfolder prefix | Use the full path including the subfolder prefix, such as FLUX2\\, to match the server's expected model name list.
