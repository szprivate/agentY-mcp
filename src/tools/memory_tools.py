agentY – Strands @tool wrappers for the local FAISS memory layer.

These two tools let the orchestrator read from and write to long-term memory
during a run.

Session binding
---------------
The pipeline calls ``set_session_id(session_id)`` before each run so both
tools operate on the correct per-user/per-session memory namespace without
requiring it as an argument in every LLM call.
